# Challenge Summary

This challenge requires you to:

    Use Venmo payments that stream in to build a graph of users and their relationship with one another.

    Calculate the median degree of a vertex in a graph and update this each time a new Venmo payment appears. You will be calculating the median degree across a 60-second sliding window.
